## Description 
This React Native application is designed to offer users the ability to toggle between light and dark themes. 
The app consists of two primary screens: Home and Settings. The ThemeContext is used to manage and provide theme state across the application. 
The NavigationContainer is styled according to the active theme, and custom components like CustomButton and Card are used to ensure reusable and consistent design.
